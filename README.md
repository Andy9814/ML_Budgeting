# ML_Budgeting App

It a Machine Learning App, using ML Kit. The user links up a bank account (we used a .csv pulled from my RBC bank accounts), 

sets a goal amount they wish to save for. They also set an auto investment value, something typically small like 1-5%. 
This will be invested into their savings account whenever they make a purchase.

The app then looks at the history of income and spending and calculates a weekly budget with an algorithm. This weekly budget is the basis for on which the whole usage process of TD Investor lies.

If successful, the app then asks the user if they want to make ANOTHER one-time investment. 

The reason for this is we found that when people spend big money on something, they often feel guilty, and want to do something financially healthy as well. So why not ask them to double their auto investment, or even match the cost as an investment for that purchase.
